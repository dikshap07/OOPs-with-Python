# OOPs-with-Python
Tutorial/Practice on Classes, Objects and Inheritance

TheSpookyHouse is a game created using OOP, where we have three rooms, and each room can have an enemy or a friend or an item that may or maynot be used as a weapon to fight the enemies.

Once you enter a room you can perform several actions, you can hug/ talk the friend, talk/fight the enemy or leave the room to go to a different room.

A player only wins if he/she defeats 2 enemies with by selecting the right weapon if it is present in their backpack, which collects the item present in the room once you enter it.

TheSpookyHouse uses several classes such as Character(from character.py), Room(From room.py), Item(item.py), GameInfo(from gameinfo.py), to use their objects and methods to 
run the game.
